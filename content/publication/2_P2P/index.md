abstract: It is a problem that as the spread of solar power generation expands, the net power demand sharply fluctuates between day and night. The P2P (Peer to Peer) Electricity Market is expected to be a solution when accumulator-users play an important role. In such background, widespread EVs are expected to participate in the P2P market and utilize the battery storage. However, in previous research, only simulation and effect verification under an ideal condition were conducted and no EV bidding agent which works in the real situation was proposed. Therefore, in this paper, a whole system of a robust automatic bidding agent of EV which works in the real situation is proposed, and case studies based on the actual EV driving data were conducted. The results show that even EVs are running irregularly, proposed EV bidding agent was able to realize benefits for EV-users and leveling effect of the power demand through the day.
