Trip map is the demo web application I made in school. 

The purpose of this app is to make our trip planning more easy. In this app, you can clip the place you want to go in the future, find the shortest way to go through the chosen spots.

I was responsible for the front-end system. Front-end is written by html, css, javascript with jquery library.
It was deployed by free heroku service.
