I study **Trustworthy AI**, focusing on adversarial robustness and reliable generalization.

I approach this from **mechanism to deployment**:

- I analyze why models fail under adversarial perturbation ([WACV'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14337)).
- I design robust training and defense methods for computer vision ([ICIP'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15519), [ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14648)).
- I extend these ideas to vision-language systems ([WACV'26](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770), [ACMMM'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16257)).

I also work on complementary reliability and security topics, including post-hoc calibration ([ICML'23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05118)) and model IP protection ([ACL'25 Main](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08604v4)).
