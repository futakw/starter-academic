Futa Waseda is a master's student in Information Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo. 

I'm interested in artificial intelligence, especially in computer vision. In particular, I'm currently trying to understand the reasons of adversarial examples, which mislead the model's prediction while they don't affect human's decision.
